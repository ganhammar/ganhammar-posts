# Getting started with GraphQL Helpers for EF Core

[GraphQL Helpers for EF Core](https://github.com/ganhammar/GraphQL.EntityFrameworkCore.Helpers) is a set of helper methods for [GraphQL for .NET](https://github.com/graphql-dotnet/graphql-dotnet) that is used to generate and resolve a GraphQL schema based on an existing DbContext. It has support for bidrectional cursor based connections in which the consuming client can define what to order the returned list by. Filters that the client can use to narrow down the list and avoiding over-fetching by only fetching what the client asks for.

## Setup

This post will only cover getting started with `GraphQL Helpers for EF Core` and assumes basic knowledge of `GraphQL for .NET`. The [sample project of GraphQL for .NET](https://github.com/ganhammar/GraphQL.EntityFrameworkCore.Helpers/tree/master/samples/HeadlessCms) could be used as a setup reference.

The first thing we'll have to do to get started is to add the nuget package:

```bash
dotnet add package GraphQL.EntityFrameworkCore.Helpers
```

And register dependencies by running the `IServiceCollection` extension method `AddGraphQLEntityFrameworkCoreHelpers` in the `Startup.cs`-class:

```c#
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services
        .AddGraphQLEntityFrameworkCoreHelpers();
}
```

## Defining graph types

Then we'll define relevant GraphTypes.

```c#
public class LoremGraphType : ObjectGraphType<Lorem>
{
    public LoremGraphType()
    {
        Name = "Lorem";

        Field(x => x.Id);
        Field(x => x.Value);
    }
}
```

```c#
public class IpsumGraphType : ObjectGraphType<Ipsum>
{
    public IpsumGraphType()
    {
        Name = "Ipsum";

        Field(x => x.Id);
        Field(x => x.Value);
    }
}
```

## Defining the schema

Next step is to define our `ISchema`-instance:

```c#
public class ApiSchema : Ischema
{
    public ApiSchema(IServiceProvider serviceProvider, ApiDbContext dbContext)
        : base(serviceProvider)
    {
        Query = new Queries(dbContext);
    }
}
```

Now we'll create the `Queries`-class used by the schema. This is where we start to see the GraphQL Helpers for EF Core in action. With the builder method `From` we define what `DbContext` and what `DbSet` we want to use to resolve the connection fields.

```c#
public class Queries : ObjectGraphType
{
    public Queries(ApiDbContext dbContext)
    {
        Connection<LoremGraphType>()
            .Name("Lorems")
            .From(dbContext, x => x.Lorems)
            .ResolveAsync();

        Connection<IpsumGraphType>()
            .Name("Ipsums")
            .From(dbContext, x => x.Ipsums)
            .ResolveAsync();
    }
}
```

Let's also add a `Field` to resolve a single `Lorem`, a _GetById_-method. To do this we'll add the argument `Id` to the query, `.Argument<NonNullGraphType<IdGraphType>>("Id")`, and use the method `Apply` to access the `IQueryable`-builder and apply our own `Where`-clause.

```c#
Field<LoremGraphType>()
    .Name("Lorem")
    .Argument<NonNullGraphType<IdGraphType>>("Id")
    .From(dbContext, x => x.Lorems)
    .Apply((query, context) =>
    {
        var id = context.GetArgument<Guid>("Id");
        return query.Where(x => x.Id == id);
    })
    .ResolvePropertyAsync();
```

If we want to add some custom validation logic to, for instance, ensure that the user has access to the `Lorem` we can do so with the `Validate` and `ValidateAsync` methods. Here we get access to the `IResolveFieldContext` and can make sure that the passed `Id` is valid for the current user.

```c#
.ValidateAsync(async context =>
{
    var result = new ValidationResult();
    var id = context.GetArgument<Guid>("id");
    var hasAccess = await AsyncUserHasAccessValidationMethod(id);

    if (hasAccess == false)
    {
        result.Failures.Add(new ValidationFailure("Id", $"The logged in user doesn't have access to the Lorem with id '{id}'"));
    }

    return result;
})
```

## Adding Data Loaded Properties to the Graph Types

Let's say there is a many-to-many relationship between `Lorem` and `Ipsum`, one `Lorem` can have many `Ipsum`. To do this we need to have a mapping class that defines this relationship in EF Core, let's call it `LoremIpsum` and it's defined like this:

```c#
public class LoremIpsum
{
    public int LoremId { get; set; }
    public int IpsumId { get; set; }
    public Lorem Lorem { get; set; }
    public Ipsum Ipsum { get; set; }
}
```

Additionally we'll have to add the collection to our `Lorem` and `Ipsum` entities.

```c#
public IEnumerable<LoremIpsum> LoremIpsums { get; set; }
```

Now it's time to update our `LoremGraphType` to be able to resolve a collection of `IpsumGraphType` from it. To do this we need to inform the helper methods what collection we want to include, we'll do that with the `MapsTo` and then the `ThenTo`. By doing this we hide the entity `LoremIpsum` in the API since it's only used as a mapping entity.

Then we call the `Include` method with the required parameters (an instance of `IDataLoaderContextAccessor` and a instance of `DbContext`). This initiates the `IQueryable`-builder, to which we can add the `Apply` and `Validate` methods mentioned earlier.

Finally we call the `ResolveAsync`-method, this creates the action that GraphQL calls when the client asks for the property.

```c#
Field<ListGraphType<IpsumGraphType>, IEnumerable<Ipsum>>()
    .Name("Ipsums")
    .MapsTo(x => x.LoremIpsum)
        .ThenTo(x => x.Ipsum)
    .Include(accessor, dbContext)
    .ResolveAsync();
```
