# OpenIddict on AWS Serverless: Adding Interactive Login

In a [previous post](https://www.ganhammar.se/posts/openiddict-on-aws-serverless-flexible-oauth2-oidc-provider), I described how OpenIddict, a flexible OAuth2/OIDC provider, can be deployed on AWS using only Serverless components such as AWS Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, and Systems Manager Parameter Store. In this post, I'll demonstrate how to extend this demo project with interactive login using Amazon S3 and Amazon CloudFront. If you haven't checked out the first post and created the baseline for this project, I recommend starting there!
