# Delegation Tokens with Amazon Cognito

The Delegation or On-Behalf-Of (OBO) flow is used when a service, often an API, needs to perform an action, often calling another API, on behalf of the end-user. This is to ensure that the end user has the permissions required to perform the action in the target service. The flow is not a part of the original OAuth 2.0 specification (RFC 6749), it is an extension introduced by Microsoft.

How the flow works:

1. The client (an application that interacts with the end-user, e.g. a web or mobile application) authenticates the end-user and obtains an access token from the authorization server.
2. The client calls the initial API, API A, passing along the access token.
3. The access token is only scoped to be able to call API A, therefore the API needs to request a new access token which is scoped to call the second API, API B. To ensure that the end-user also has the correct permissions to call API B, it passes along the original access token.
4. The authorization server validates the incoming token and the client's credentials and issues a new access token.
5. API A uses this new access token to call API B, which is then scoped to be able to access API B based on the end-user's permissions.

# Implementation, the Cognito Way 

Amazon Cognito does not support this flow out of the box; however, they do support custom authentication flows, which we can use for our solution. Custom authentication flows are defined using AWS Lambda triggers. These triggers can be used to add custom validation, challenges for the user, such as additional authentication factors, or even to integrate with external systems.

The triggers are:

1. **Define Auth Challenge** which is used to determine the next challenge in a custom auth flow, such as asking the user for additional information, or calling an external system.
2. **Create Auth Challenge** which is used to create a custom auth challenge for the end-user, based on the session information and the challenge name, such as emailing a one-time password, which is also passed downstream to Cognito.
3. **Verify Auth Challenge** which is used to determine if the response is correct. In the one-time password example, it verifies that the answer from the end-user matches what was passed downstream.

We can use this custom authentication flow to implement the delegation flow. We utilize the Define Auth Challenge lambda to return a DELEGATION challenge for the end-user and the Verify Auth Challenge lambda to verify that the answer contains a valid JWT.

The problem with the custom auth flow is that we cannot request any scope(s) with the token request, but it is possible to pass client metadata with the request. We can use this parameter together with the Cognito trigger "Pre Token Generation", which can be used to add or remove claims and scopes, to add the necessary scopes required to call API B. As of a week ago, we can use this trigger to modify the access token properties (which require Cognito Advanced Security).

## Defining the Stack

We will use CDK to define our stack, I will focus on the parts essential for this solution, the complete example can be found [here](https://github.com/ganhammar/delegation-with-amazon-cognito).

Let's start with creating a new CDK project by running `cdk init app --language typescript` in an empty folder called "delegation" and edit the `delegation-stack.ts`-file to add a UserPool and enable advanced security mode:

```typescript
// Create user pool
const userPool = new UserPool(this, "UserPool", {
  userPoolName: "delegation",
  customAttributes: {
    permission: new StringAttribute({ mutable: true }),
  },
});

userPool.addDomain("UserPoolDomain", {
  cognitoDomain: {
    domainPrefix: "delegation",
  },
});

// Enable advanced security
const cfnUserPool = userPool.node.defaultChild as CfnUserPool;
cfnUserPool.userPoolAddOns = {
  advancedSecurityMode: "ENFORCED",
};

// Store user pool id in SSM, to be used by Lambda integrations
new StringParameter(this, "UserPoolIdParameter", {
  parameterName: "/delegation/userpool/id",
  stringValue: userPool.userPoolId,
});
```

Then we will add a resource server to manage the scopes required to access our different services, in this example I will add a booking service and a review service.

```typescript
// Add resource server
const resourceServer = userPool.addResourceServer("ResourceServer", {
  identifier: "resources",
  scopes: [
    {
      scopeName: "booking-service",
      scopeDescription: "Access booking service",
    },
    {
      scopeName: "review-service",
      scopeDescription: "Access review service",
    },
  ],
});
```

Next, we will define Pre Token Generation Lambda (pre-token-generation.ts), which we store in a new folder called `handlers` in the `lib`-folder. The type definitions for Pre Token Generation V2 have not yet been included in the `aws-lambda`-package, so it must be manually defined, they can be found [here](https://github.com/ganhammar/delegation-with-amazon-cognito/blob/main/lib/handlers/pre-token-generation.ts). I have excluded them in the below code:

```typescript
export const handler = async (event: PreTokenGenerationTriggerHandler) => {
  const scopesToAdd = [];

  // Check if the clientMetadata property is set and contains scope
  if (event.request?.clientMetadata?.scope) {
    const scopes = event.request.clientMetadata.scope.split(" ");

    // Verify that the client actually has access to the requested scope(s)
    const cognitoClient = new CognitoIdentityProviderClient({
      region: "eu-north-1",
    });

    const region = process.env.AWS_REGION!;
    const ssmClient = new SSMClient({ region });
    const ssmCommand = new GetParameterCommand({
      Name: "/delegation/userpool/id",
    });
    const userPoolId = (await ssmClient.send(ssmCommand)).Parameter!.Value!;

    const command = new DescribeUserPoolClientCommand({
      UserPoolId: userPoolId,
      ClientId: event.callerContext.clientId,
    });

    const data = await cognitoClient.send(command);

    const clientScopes = data.UserPoolClient?.AllowedOAuthScopes || [];

    for (const scope of scopes) {
      if (clientScopes.includes(scope)) {
        scopesToAdd.push(event.request.clientMetadata.scope);
      }
    }
  }

  event.response = {
    claimsAndScopeOverrideDetails: {
      idTokenGeneration: {
        scopesToAdd,
      },
      accessTokenGeneration: {
        scopesToAdd,
      },
    },
  };

  return event;
};
```

Then we will continue to update our stack and add the Pre Token Generation trigger:

```typescript
// Define pre token generation lambda
const preTokenGeneration = new NodejsFunction(this, "PreTokenGeneration", {
  runtime: Runtime.NODEJS_20_X,
  handler: "handler",
  entry: `${__dirname}/handlers/pre-token-generation.ts`,
  memorySize: 1769,
});

preTokenGeneration.addToRolePolicy(
  new PolicyStatement({
    actions: ["ssm:GetParameter"],
    resources: [
      Stack.of(this).formatArn({
        service: "ssm",
        resource: "parameter/delegation/userpool/id",
      }),
    ],
  }),
);

preTokenGeneration.addToRolePolicy(
  new PolicyStatement({
    actions: ["cognito-idp:DescribeUserPoolClient"],
    resources: ["*"],
  })
);

userPool.addTrigger(
  UserPoolOperation.PRE_TOKEN_GENERATION,
  preTokenGeneration
); // Needs to be changed to V2_0 in console until CDK supports it
```

Next, we will define the Define Auth Challenge Lambda in the same folder as our other handler:

```typescript
import { Callback, Context, DefineAuthChallengeTriggerEvent } from "aws-lambda";

exports.handler = function (
  event: DefineAuthChallengeTriggerEvent,
  _: Context,
  callback: Callback
) {
  if (event.request.session.length === 0) {
    // If it's the first sign in attempt, present the password verifier challenge
    event.response.issueTokens = false;
    event.response.failAuthentication = false;
    event.response.challengeName = "DELEGATION";
  } else if (
    event.request.session.length === 1 &&
    event.request.session[0].challengeResult === true
  ) {
    // If the password verifier returns a successful result, issue tokens
    event.response.issueTokens = true;
    event.response.failAuthentication = false;
  } else {
    // If the password verifier returns a failed result, fail authentication
    event.response.issueTokens = false;
    event.response.failAuthentication = true;
  }

  callback(null, event);
};
```

And update our stack to connect the handler with the UserPool:

```typescript
// Define auth challenge lambda
const defineAuthChallenge = new NodejsFunction(
  this,
  "DefineAuthChallenge",
  {
    runtime: Runtime.NODEJS_20_X,
    handler: "handler",
    entry: `${__dirname}/handlers/define-auth-challenge.ts`,
    memorySize: MEMORY_SIZE,
  }
);

userPool.addTrigger(
  UserPoolOperation.DEFINE_AUTH_CHALLENGE,
  defineAuthChallenge
);
```

Lastly, we will create the Verify Auth Challenge Response Lambda. This Lambda needs to verify the end-user's Access Token, which there are loads of examples of out there. The source code for how I did it in the example below can be found [here](https://github.com/ganhammar/delegation-with-amazon-cognito/blob/main/lib/handlers/utils/verify-token.ts).

```typescript
import { Callback, Context, VerifyAuthChallengeResponseTriggerEvent } from "aws-lambda";
import { SSMClient, GetParameterCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-ssm";
import { validateToken } from "./utils/verify-token";

exports.handler = async function (
  event: VerifyAuthChallengeResponseTriggerEvent,
  _: Context,
  callback: Callback
) {
  const region = process.env.AWS_REGION!;
  const ssmClient = new SSMClient({ region });
  const command = new GetParameterCommand({ Name: "/delegation/userpool/id" });
  const userPoolId = (await ssmClient.send(command)).Parameter!.Value!;

  // Check if the user's answer matches the secret code
  if (event.request.challengeAnswer) {
    const result = await validateToken(event.request.challengeAnswer, userPoolId, region);

    if (result) {
      event.response.answerCorrect = true;
    }
  } else {
    event.response.answerCorrect = false;
  }

  callback(null, event);
};
```

And use the Lambda handler as a trigger in our UserPool:

```typescript
// Define verify auth challenge response lambda
const verifyAuthChallengeResponse = new NodejsFunction(
  this,
  "VerifyAuthChallengeResponse",
  {
    runtime: Runtime.NODEJS_20_X,
    handler: "handler",
    entry: `${__dirname}/handlers/verify-auth-challenge-response.ts`,
    memorySize: MEMORY_SIZE,
    environment: {
      REGION: this.region,
    },
  }
);

verifyAuthChallengeResponse.addToRolePolicy(
  new PolicyStatement({
    actions: ["ssm:GetParameter"],
    resources: [
      Stack.of(this).formatArn({
        service: "ssm",
        resource: "parameter/delegation/userpool/id",
      }),
    ],
  })
);

userPool.addTrigger(
  UserPoolOperation.VERIFY_AUTH_CHALLENGE_RESPONSE,
  verifyAuthChallengeResponse
);
```

That's it, we have now added the resources required for our custom auth flow, the next steps are to add our clients to test the solution with. The first client, "BookingFrontClient" is the front-end client, used by the end user to authenticate, the second client, "BookingServiceClient", is used by the booking service to get a token that can communicate with the review service.

```typescript
// Create booking frontend client
const bookingFrontClient = new UserPoolClient(this, "BookingFrontClient", {
  userPool,
  generateSecret: false,
  userPoolClientName: "booking-front",
  authFlows: {
    userPassword: false,
    userSrp: true,
    custom: false,
    adminUserPassword: false,
  },
  oAuth: {
    flows: {
      authorizationCodeGrant: true,
    },
    scopes: [
      OAuthScope.EMAIL,
      OAuthScope.OPENID,
      OAuthScope.PROFILE,
      OAuthScope.custom(
        `${resourceServer.userPoolResourceServerId}/booking-service`
      ),
    ],
    callbackUrls: ["http://localhost:3000"],
    logoutUrls: ["http://localhost:3000"],
  },
});

// Create booking service client
const bookingServiceClient = new UserPoolClient(
  this,
  "BookingServiceClient",
  {
    userPool,
    generateSecret: true,
    userPoolClientName: "booking-service",
    oAuth: {
      flows: {
        clientCredentials: true,
      },
      scopes: [
        OAuthScope.custom(
          `${resourceServer.userPoolResourceServerId}/review-service`
        ),
      ],
    },
  }
);
```

## Testing the Solution

To test the delegation flow we need to first authenticate using the "BookingFrontClient", this can be done through any API client such as Insomnia or Postman, or you could use the simple client defined in the [companion repository](https://github.com/ganhammar/delegation-with-amazon-cognito/tree/main/src/client) of this post. In order to have any user to login with, you would also need to register a user, this can be done through the AWS Console.

Once you have an access token that is authenticated using the "BookingFrontClient" it is time to initiate the custom auth. In order to do this, you first need to have the client secret of the "BookingServiceClient" using a combination of the client id and the end user username:

```typescript
import { createHmac } from "crypto";

export function getSecretHash(
  clientId: string,
  clientSecret: string,
  username: string
): string {
  const message = `${username}${clientId}`;
  return createHmac("SHA256", clientSecret).update(message).digest("base64");
}
```

To test the above script, you could write a simple script that import the `getSecretHash`-function and calls it using arguments passed when invoking the wrapping script:

```typescript
import { getSecretHash } from "./path/to/get-secret-hash";

const [clientId, clientSecret, username] = process.argv.slice(2);

console.log(getSecretHash(clientId, clientSecret, username));
```

Running this script will give you the secret hash required to initiate the custom auth. Run the following curl command to initiate the auth and get a session id, which is required to respond to the challenge:

```sh
curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/x-amz-json-1.1" \
  -H "X-Amz-Target: AWSCognitoIdentityProviderService.InitiateAuth" \
  -d '{
    "AuthFlow": "CUSTOM_AUTH",
    "ClientId": "<clientId>",
    "AuthParameters": {
      "USERNAME": "<username>",
      "SECRET_HASH": "<secretHash>"
    }
  }' \
  "<cognitoUrl>"
```

To respond to the auth challenge, the below curl command can be run. Replace the scope parameter with the scope required to call the second API (API B), in this case, `resources/review-service`. The ANSWER should be the end-user's JWT, required through the "BookingFrontClient". The Session-parameter is received when initiating the auth. The rest of the parameters should be the same as during initiation.

```sh
curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/x-amz-json-1.1" \
  -H "X-Amz-Target: AWSCognitoIdentityProviderService.RespondToAuthChallenge" \
  -d '{
    "ChallengeName": "CUSTOM_CHALLENGE",
    "ClientId": "<clientId>",
    "Session": "<initiateAuthData.Session>",
    "ChallengeResponses": {
      "USERNAME": "<username>",
      "ANSWER": "<accessToken>",
      "SECRET_HASH": "<secretHash>"
    },
    "ClientMetadata": {
      "scope": "<scope>"
    }
  }' \
  "<cognitoUrl>"
```

And that is it, now you have an access token that can be used to call API B, the review service, which is based on the end-user's credentials but with the required scopes. A complete example with a Rest API and a test frontend client can be found in the companion repository [here](https://github.com/ganhammar/delegation-with-amazon-cognito).

The next step for this solution would be to add fine grained permissions for the end user, based on the requesting client, to keep the access token relatively light weight. This can be done through the Pre Token Generation trigger and a custom permissions store.
